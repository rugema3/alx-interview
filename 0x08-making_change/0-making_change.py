    Determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total amount.

    Args:
        coins (list of int): List of coin values available.
        total (int): The target total amount.

    Returns:
        int: Fewest number of coins needed to meet the total amount.
             Returns -1 if the total cannot be met by any combination of coins.

    Note:
        - If total is 0 or less, returns 0.
        - The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0.
        - You can assume you have an infinite number of each
            denomination of coin in the list.
